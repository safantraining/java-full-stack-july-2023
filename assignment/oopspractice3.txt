1 â€“ Interface

Create a package com.shape containing the following classes and interfaces.
An interface Polygon containing the members as given below:
void calcArea( );	Method to calculate area 
void calcPeri( ); 	Method to calculate perimeter 
Create a class Square that implements Polygon and has the following member:
		side 	float
Create another class Rectangle that implements Polygon and has the following member:
		length		float
		breadth	float
In another package com.test, create a class that imports the above package and instantiates an object of the Square class and an object of the Rectangle class. 
Call the methods on each of the classes to calculate the area and perimeter given the side and the length/breadth of the Square class and the Rectangle class respectively.

2- Inheritance and Abstraction
**Create an abstract class Cricket with following private member variables**
     maxOvers(int) targetScore(int) , currentOver(int), currentScore(int)  

* Provide getter methods for all variables. 
* Provide setter methods for currentOver and currentScore.
* Set the maxOvers and targetScore in the Constructor
* Create abstract methods calcCurrentRunrate and calcReqdRunrate which return a double 
    
Create SubClass of Cricket named OneDayCricket. maxOvers for one day cricket is fixed at 50.

* Implement the abstract methods as follows:
* Current Run rate is calculated using formula current Score / current over.  
* Required Run rate is calculated using formula Remaining Runs / Remaining overs.

* Create CricketTest class with main method.
   * Using scanner to accept the target runs, current over, current score
   * Create object of Oneday cricket with the accepted target runs 
   * Set the current over and current score
   * Display the current Run rate and Required run rate in the output

		Sample Input :
		Enter Target Runs
		250
		Enter Current Over
		25
		Enter Current Score
		125
		
		Sample Output :
	       Current Run Rate
	      5.0
	      Required Run Rate
	      5.0
